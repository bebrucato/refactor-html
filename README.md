# Horiseon Refactor Assignment 

For this assignment, our task was to clean up the code from the original file and make it more accessible. By utilizing the semantic elements; Header, Nav, Main, Section, Aside, Footer, etc... I was able to remove most of the Div elements from the original file and use descriptive, informative elements instead.

## Refactor Specifics:

In the html file, I added notes to describe where I removed Divs and impleneted elemental changes. One of the first challenges I encountered was changing elements and consolidating Divs without altering the original design and function of the site. Through trial and error, I was able to reduce some of the CSS commands and group together specific elements. I also added alt text to every image and icon to ensure that the site would meet accessibility standards and increase the SEO.
